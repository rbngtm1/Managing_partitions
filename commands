#### Creating partitions
to see partition in disk
cat /proc/partitions  (here sdb don't have any nely partitions
fdisk /dev/sdb
m --print the menu
p for printing sector info
n for new partitions 


you will get options

partion number   (you may select default)
first sector  (you may use default)
last sector              (if you use enter will use the entire disk) option is +size{K,M,G,T,P} you may use sth like +100M

p to check what changes you made and w will write to disk

if you get some error like Device or resource busy, just reboot.
